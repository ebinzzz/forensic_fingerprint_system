# Forensic Fingerprint Matching System

A full-stack web application for **forensic-grade fingerprint matching**, designed for government and law enforcement use.  
This system provides a **secure, auditable, and highly accurate** tool for comparing fingerprint evidence.

## ðŸ”¬ Algorithm: Multi-Stage Forensic Analysis
The system uses a **multi-stage fingerprint matching algorithm** that combines advanced computer vision methods to ensure forensic reliability.

### 1. Feature Extraction â€” **SIFT**
- Identifies unique, stable points (**keypoints**) on fingerprint images.  
- Creates descriptors that remain consistent even under **scaling, rotation, or lighting variations**.  
- Provides a strong foundation for robust matching.

### 2. Feature Matching â€” **FLANN**
- Uses the **Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN)** for efficient descriptor matching.  
- Significantly faster than brute-force methods.  
- Applies **Loweâ€™s ratio test** to filter out false matches.

### 3. Geometric Verification â€” **RANSAC**
- Removes outliers (false matches that pass initial filters).  
- Finds a geometric model that aligns the two prints.  
- Ensures only **geometrically consistent matches** are accepted.  
- Guarantees forensic-level accuracy by validating structural fingerprint similarity.

## âœ… Key Features
- **Forensic-Grade Accuracy**  
  Multi-stage algorithm with **SIFT, FLANN, and RANSAC** for low false-positive rates.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**  
  Generates reports in **JSON** and **PDF** formats:  
  - Case summary  
  - Keypoint match metrics  
  - Visual match overview  

- **Image Integrity Verification**  
  Includes **SHA256 hash** of uploaded images to preserve evidence integrity.

- **Adaptive Confidence Scoring**  
  Confidence is based on the number of **geometrically verified inliers**, making it more reliable than raw match counts.

- **Image Quality Assessment**  
  Evaluates fingerprints before matching using:  
  - Laplacian variance  
  - Contrast metrics  
  Helps identify poor-quality evidence.

- **Secure & Auditable**  
  Every operation is logged with:  
  - **Case ID**  
  - **Operator ID**  
  - **Timestamp**  
  Ensures a transparent and verifiable audit trail.
